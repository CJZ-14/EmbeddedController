        List of ALS sensors to create motion_als_sensors array.
        The ALS sensors listed in the motion_als_sensors array
        are managed by motion sense task. The task reads the sensor
        data from the sensors and put them into the designated part
        in the ec mmap. For example, als_clear and als_rgb are aliases
        of ALS sensor noded defined in motionsense-sensor node.
        als-sensors = <&als_clear, &als_rgb>;
        This will automatically generate motion_als_sensors array from it.

#        als-sensors = <&als_clear>;
